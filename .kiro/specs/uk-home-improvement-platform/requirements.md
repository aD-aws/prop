# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UK Home Improvement Platform is a comprehensive web application that streamlines the process of planning, scoping, and contracting home improvement projects in the UK. The platform analyzes customer inputs including structural designs, calculations, and requirements to generate detailed Scopes of Work (SoW) that comply with UK building regulations. It facilitates the quote collection process from multiple builders and enables contract generation for selected quotes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a homeowner with no construction experience, I want to be guided through inputting details about my home improvement project, so that I can receive a detailed scope of work and cost estimates.

4. WHEN a user selects a project type THEN the system SHALL provide educational content explaining what each project type involves, typical costs, and timeframes
5. WHEN a user selects a project type THEN the system SHALL display step-by-step guided forms with tooltips and examples for that specific project category
6. WHEN a user uploads structural designs or calculations THEN the system SHALL accept common file formats (PDF, DWG, JPG, PNG) and store them securely
7. WHEN a user provides project requirements THEN the system SHALL capture detailed specifications including dimensions, materials preferences, timeline, and budget constraints through guided questionnaires

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN creating the SoW THEN the system SHALL include detailed specifications, materials lists, work phases, and deliverables with no ambiguity following RICS professional standards
6. IF critical information is missing THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for specific additional details before generating the SoW
7. WHEN the SoW is complete THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates based on current UK market rates and material costs using industry-standard measurement methods

### Requirement 3

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a builder, I want to receive detailed Scopes of Work following industry standards, so that I can provide accurate quotes for home improvement projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a builder receives a SoW invitation THEN the system SHALL provide access to all project documentation and specifications structured according to RIBA Plan of Work stages
2. WHEN reviewing a SoW THEN the system SHALL present information using standard industry formats and measurement methods (NRM1/NRM2) that builders are familiar with
3. WHEN reviewing a SoW THEN the system SHALL allow builders to ask clarification questions through the platform
